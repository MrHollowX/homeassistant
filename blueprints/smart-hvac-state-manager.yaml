    # 🏠 Advanced Climate & Window Interlock
    
    This blueprint transforms your HVAC into a "Living System" that reacts intelligently to doors and windows. It solves the complex problem of managing heating (Winter) and cooling (Summer) with different logic strategies.
    
    **Version 1.1** includes a robust "Clean Slate" memory system that prevents errors when multiple windows are opened sequentially and fixes trace errors.

    ### ⚙️ Key Features
    * **❄️ Winter Mode (Heating):** Switches your KNX/Thermostat to a safe preset (e.g., `Building Protection`) when windows open. It remembers your previous mode (`Comfort`, `Eco`, etc.) and restores it only when *all* windows close.
    * **🔥 Summer Mode (Cooling):** Cuts power to AC units to save energy. It remembers if the AC was actually running and only turns it back on if it was previously active.
    * **🧠 First-In Memory:** Prevents "State Amnesia." If you open Window A (saving 'Comfort' mode), then open Window B, the system is smart enough NOT to overwrite the memory with the current 'Protection' mode.
    * **🛡️ Zigbee Filter:** Ignores brief `unavailable` states common in Zigbee meshes to prevent ghost switching.

    ### 📋 Requirements (Create these Helpers first!)
    1. **Season Switch** (`input_boolean`):
       * `On` = Summer (Cooling Logic)
       * `Off` = Winter (Heating Logic)
    2. **Winter Memory** (`input_text`):
       * Stores the name of the heating preset (e.g., 'comfort').
    3. **Summer Memory** (`input_boolean`):
       * Stores the state of the AC (On/Off).
